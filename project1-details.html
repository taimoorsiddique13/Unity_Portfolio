        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The game “Rising Sun: The land of Resilience” is a 3D Action-RPG game, depicting the journey of a young Palestinian boy,
        as he navigates through the Palestine-Israel conflict. The players will live the virtual life of Ahmed and experience
        the life of a Palestinian child and his hardships. The main reason for this is to enable players to know the real
        struggles of the Palestinians and their losses. The gameplay revolves around Ahmed who in his childhood loses his family
        as Israeli forces forcefully attack Palestine. The game consists of various chapters, each presenting unique challenges
        and opportunities for the players to engage in Ahmed’s journey. The players will gain insight into the human side of the
        Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Rising Sun represents more than just a game, it is a powerful tool for education. We aim
        to spark conversation, challenge perceptions, and inspire positivity in the young generation to stand up against
        oppression and face hardships with a high head. Some events in the past made us think of a way to let the gaming
        community know about Israeli oppression and cruelty. We hope that this game does some good for the community and
        especially for the Palestinians!</p>
