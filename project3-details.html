        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A simple painting game made as an assignment during the first month my internship at Narsun Studios. The game is
        designed to paint the 2d texture having UV map of the object to be painted. The user paints the UV map of the object and
        the object gets painted automatically in the 3d View. The unwrapping of the texture was an intense but rewarding
        experience.</p>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>2D Texture Painting:</strong> Users can paint directly on a <strong>UV map</strong> of the 3D object.</li>
          <li><strong>Real-time 3D Update:</strong> The painted texture is automatically applied to the 3D object in real time.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Custom UV Unwrapping:</strong> The game involves manually unwrapping textures for accurate mapping.</li>
          <li><strong>User-friendly Painting Tools:</strong> Different brush sizes, colors, and possibly an <strong>eraser
              tool</strong> for corrections.</li>
          <li><strong>Interactive 3D Preview:</strong> The object updates dynamically, allowing users to see their artwork from
            different angles.</li>
          <li><strong>Texture Saving and Loading:</strong> Users can save their painted textures and load them later.</li>
          <li><strong>Performance Optimized Workflow:</strong> Handling texture painting efficiently to ensure smooth rendering.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Internship Project at Narsun Studios:</strong> Developed as part of your <strong>first-month
              assignment</strong>, focusing on technical skills like <strong>UV mapping and texture application</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
